- Roughly 100% of the work done to make this extension possible was by [jmviz](https://github.com/jmviz), as he created the model that it's built from. Check out their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jmviz/when-to-berserk-on-lichess) and [lichess blogpost](https://lichess.org/@/jmviz/blog/when-should-you-berserk/rQdcB4QB).
- [radilx](https://github.com/radilx) (a.k.a. [samzchespl](https://www.twitch.tv/samzchespl)) for writing the CSS

### Potential updates
- [ ] Expand support for more time controls (currently only 1+0 and 3+0 are supported)
- [ ] Train model off specific player's (your own) data
